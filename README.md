#CSS Animation Completeness

Intended to be a library which returns the state of an object at any given point in a css animation's timeline.

The animation must be defined in a stylesheet somewhere available to the document.

When functioning, the syntax should be

    completeness([className], [time])

Where time is a value 0-1.
